# Hi, I'm Rithika Sankar Rajeswari 👋

**🎓 Graduate Student | Data Science • Machine Learning • LLMs • Data Engineering**

I'm a Master's student in **Data Analytics Engineering** at **Northeastern University**, deeply focused on building intelligent, data-driven systems — from scalable data pipelines to machine learning models and modern LLM-powered applications.

I enjoy working at the intersection of data, engineering, and AI, where raw data is transformed into reliable systems, meaningful insights, and production-ready ML solutions.

---

## 🚀 What I'm Focused On Right Now

* **Data Science & Machine Learning**: End-to-end model development, evaluation, and deployment
* **Deep Learning & Neural Networks**: CNNs, sequence models, optimization, and experimentation
* **LLMs & Generative AI**: Prompt engineering, RAG pipelines, fine-tuning, and model evaluation
* **Data Engineering**: Scalable ETL/ELT pipelines, cloud data warehouses, and workflow orchestration
* **MLOps**: Reproducible experiments, model tracking, versioning, and deployment workflows

I care deeply about clean design, strong fundamentals, and real-world impact — not just notebooks that run, but systems that scale.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a curious and driven problem solver who learns quickly and loves tackling complex challenges. My background spans data analytics, engineering, and applied machine learning,  and I'm genuinely passionate about turning messy problems into clean, robust solutions. This approach allows me to:

* Extract meaningful insights by asking the right questions of data
* Build data systems that are robust, scalable, and maintainable
* Create ML models that are explainable and drive real-world impact
* Embrace experimentation and treat every project as an opportunity to learn
* Communicate technical concepts clearly across all audiences

*"I believe strong data systems are the foundation that make great models reliable, scalable, and trustworthy"*
